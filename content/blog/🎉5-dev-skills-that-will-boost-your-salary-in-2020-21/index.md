I remember getting a 20% raise in my salary after 3 months of self studying node.js with couple online courses. Self learning is a crucial part of being a software developer.

ðŸ¤”What skills can optimize your market value as a developer in 2020? 

I have curated a list of emerging dev skills based on data insights from StackOverflow developer survey, **Indeed** and **RemoteOk** and **Linkedin**.


### 1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

AWS emerged as the most diverse and widely adopted cloud service among many companies. Big, small alike most companies are moving to cloud from on prem. Moreover, many larger organizations are concerned with scaling than ever before. AWS being of the major cloud provider in the space there is a huge demand for developers with **AWS** skills. 

### 2. **React.js**

React.js has surpassed all the other modern frontend framework in 2019 and it is growing. Backed by Facebook and trusted by some of the industry giants React is becoming the framework that everyone loves. React has a solid community behind it and has introduced some great features like hooks in 2019 that accelerated its popularity. The demand for good react developers will continue to rise in 2020. If you are already familiar with React it would be a good idea to learn some of the other tools in the ecosystem such as **GraphQL**, **SSR** etc.

### 3. **GO**

Googleâ€™s GO language is gaining popularity. There are tons of remote companies that are actively looking for GO developers in North America and Europe. If you are already proficient with either one of Node.js, Ruby on Rails or PHP (Laravel) you should pickup GO as your second backend language of choice. If you are new to backend development, I would not recommend GO right away. I noticed most of the GO jobs listed are geared towards senior devs so it might not be very practical to learn GO as someone who is just starting out. GO is also very efficient in developing cloud native applications.

### 4. **Redis**

If you are thinking of picking up a new database/datastore to learn Redis is the way to go. StackOverflow rates Redis as most loved and rapidly growing technology.  
Unlike traditional databases Redis is an in-memory data structure store. Redis is a popular choice among large scale applications and microservices as it can be easily implemented and can be used as a message broker and caching system. 

### 5. **Apache Spark**

If you are already a full stack developer and looking to wet your feet in the big data field then Apache Spark will be a profitable skill to have. Data gathering and analysis is becoming crucial for many organizations. Thus demands for developers with data skills is also on the rise. 

These are my top picks. Would love to hear what you think. Do you agree/disagree? Have I missed something? Let me know in the comment section. Until next time ðŸ˜€
